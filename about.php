    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an IT and Cybersecurity enthusiast with hands-on experience in infrastructure support, 
      networking, and system analysis. With certifications in networking and practical exposure 
      in IT technical support and system environments, I am passionate about building secure, reliable, 
      and efficient technology solutions.

          I have worked on projects involving system security, file integrity monitoring, and IT infrastructure
           support, where I developed strong analytical, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills. 
           My interests lie in network security, infrastructure management, and emerging cybersecurity 
           technologies.

        I am continuously learning and improving my technical expertise, aiming to grow into a Network Security or IT 
        Infrastructure Specialist role. I value discipline, continuous improvement, and delivering solutions that make 
        systems more secure and efficient.
